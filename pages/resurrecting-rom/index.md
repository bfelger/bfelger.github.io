This is a series of posts about reviving and old, favorite project of mine, a MUD last released in 1997 called Rivers of MUD (ROM).

1. [Resurrecting ROM &mdash; Getting it to Compile Under Linux With GCC](pt-1-compile-gcc) - Starting with Ubuntu and GCC 11.3, getting ROM to compile and run without any build errors or warnings. _[2023-05-06]_
2. [Resurrecting ROM &mdash; Getting it to Compile With Clang and Cygwin](pt-2-compile-clang) - Continuing Ubuntu and Clang 14, then adding support for Cygwin on Windows. _[2023-05-10]_
