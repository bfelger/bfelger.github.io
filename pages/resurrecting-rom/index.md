# Resurrecting ROM

This is a series of posts about reviving and old, favorite project of mine, a MUD last released in 1997 called Rivers of MUD (ROM).

1. [Resurrecting ROM &mdash; Getting it to Compile Under Linux With GCC](pt-1-compile-gcc) - Starting with Ubuntu and GCC 11.3, getting ROM to compile and run without any build errors or warnings. _[2023-05-06]_
2. [Resurrecting ROM &mdash; Getting it to Compile With Clang and Cygwin](pt-2-compile-clang) - Continuing Ubuntu and Clang 14, then adding support for Cygwin on Windows. _[2023-05-09]_
3. [Resurrecting ROM &mdash; Dusting Off the Cobwebs](pt-3-dusting-off-cobwebs) - Excising old, archaic platforms to reduce macro hell (so we can add it back in Part 5). _[2023-05-10]_
4. [Resurrecting ROM &mdash; Cross-Platform Compilation With CMake](pt-4-cmake) - "One build system to rule them all." Leaning into MSVC support for CMake/Ninja, and getting lighting-fast build times, to boot. Also, updating to the C2X Draft Standard. _[2023-05-11]_
